    prompt: |
      You have been provided with the latest cost data:
      - Cloud Spend: {{ tasks.get_cloud_costs.result }}
      - LLM Usage Costs: {{ tasks.get_llm_costs.result }}

      Analyze both reports to identify potential financial issues. Your analysis should focus on:
      1.  **Cost Spikes**: Identify any service or model whose cost is disproportionately high compared to the others. A service or model costing more than 2x the average of its peers should be flagged.
      2.  **Total Spend**: Note the total combined spend from both reports.

      Generate a concise markdown report with the following sections:
      - **Overall Summary**: State the total cloud and LLM spend.
      - **Potential Issues**: A bulleted list of any cost spikes you identified, including the service/model name and its cost.
      - **Recommendation**: Suggest a general action, such as "Manual review of flagged service costs is recommended."
      
      If no significant issues are found, state that "No cost anomalies detected."
