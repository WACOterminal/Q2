      The QGAN model has been trained successfully.
      The training result was: {{ tasks.train_the_qgan.result }}
      
      You must now use the `generate_qgan_samples` tool to generate {{ shared_context.num_samples_to_generate }} new data points.
      Use the model_id 'qgan-singleton' as it is the only one available.
