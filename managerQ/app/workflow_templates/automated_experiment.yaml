    prompt: |
      An experiment has been designed. You must implement the proposed change in a new feature branch.
      Hypothesis: {{ tasks.formulate_hypothesis.result.hypothesis }}
      Proposed Change: {{ tasks.formulate_hypothesis.result.proposed_change_description }}
      Target Service: {{ shared_context.target_service }}
      
      Use your code modification tools to create a new branch and apply this change. Your final output must be the name of the new feature branch.

    agent_personality: "scenario_architect"
    prompt: "Run the benchmark scenario '{{ shared_context.benchmark_scenario }}' against the experimental feature branch '{{ tasks.implement_experiment.result }}'. This requires configuring the sandbox to use the new code. Your final output must be the full simulation results."

      The experiment is complete.
      Hypothesis: {{ tasks.formulate_hypothesis.result.hypothesis }}
      Benchmark Results: {{ tasks.run_benchmark.result }}
      
      Analyze the results to determine if the hypothesis was supported, refuted, or if the results are inconclusive.
      Your final answer must be a markdown report containing your conclusion and a recommendation on whether to merge the change.
      Your conclusion must contain the string "Conclusion: SUPPORTED" or "Conclusion: REFUTED".

      The scientific experiment was a success and the hypothesis was supported.
      You must now merge the feature branch '{{ tasks.implement_experiment.result }}' into the main branch to deploy the improvement.
      Use the appropriate git tool to perform the merge.
