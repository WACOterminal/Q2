    prompt: |
      Your mission is to provide continuous, real-time anomaly detection of a high-frequency data stream.

      1.  **Configure the SNN**: Your first step is to configure the Spiking Neural Network to monitor the topic specified in the shared context: `{{ shared_context.market_data_topic }}`. Use the appropriate tool.
      2.  **Enter Monitoring Loop**: Once the network is configured, you must repeatedly use the `get_snn_anomalies` tool to check for threats.
      3.  **Report Immediately**: If you detect any anomalies, your task is complete. You must immediately report the JSON output from the tool as your final answer.
      
      This is a long-running, critical task. Begin.
