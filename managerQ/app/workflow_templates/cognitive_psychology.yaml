    prompt: |
      You have been provided with the recent thought history of the '{{ shared_context.target_personality }}' agent:
      {{ tasks.get_thought_history.result }}

      Analyze this history to identify flawed reasoning patterns or cognitive inefficiencies. Look for repeated errors, missed opportunities, or inefficient tool usage.

      Your task is to formulate a "Cognitive Enhancement". This should be a specific, actionable recommendation for how to improve the agent's system prompt to correct the identified flaw.

      Your final answer must be a JSON object with two fields:
      1. `cognitive_flaw_summary`: A concise description of the flaw you identified.
      2. `prompt_enhancement_suggestion`: The specific text to be added to or changed in the target agent's system prompt to fix the flaw.

    prompt: |
      You have formulated a cognitive enhancement. Now, you must formally propose this change.
      Use the `propose_prompt_update` tool with the following parameters:
      - `agent_personality`: "{{ shared_context.target_personality }}"
      - `new_prompt_suggestion`: "{{ tasks.analyze_and_suggest_enhancement.result.prompt_enhancement_suggestion }}"
      
      Your final answer is the confirmation from the tool.
